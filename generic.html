							<p>I have been playing soccer since I was 2 years old. My Dad bought me a proffesional size soccer ball and I could not let go of it I would always say "balla". He later purchased a soccer net for me that would yell "goaaaaaallllllllllll" every time it went in. I fell in love with the sport for two reasons. One it was fun to play and two it was some fun time with my dad.</p>
							<p>I have played on 15 different soccer teams. My favorite memory of the sport is when my 10 year old club team won the Columbus day tournoument being undefeated. This year I was the captain of my soccer team under the direction of Coach Moran and the assist with my fellow teammate Luke Haslem. Our season wasn't perfect but definitley one to remember.</p>
